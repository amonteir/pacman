# Pacman game

This is a clone of the original and legendary [Pacman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man) game, written in C++. 
I used Visual Studio 2019 and [vcpkg](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vcpkg?view=vs-2019)
to install the required libraries such as [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/).

This is how you install SDL2 with vcpkg and use it in Visual Studio 2019.
1. Download and install vcpkg.
2. Open powershell and in the vcpkg root directory, run the vcpkg bootstrapper `<bootstrap-vcpkg.bat>`
 .\vcpkg.exe search sdl2
 .\vcpkg.exe 
 .\vcpkg.exe integrate install






Enjoy. I am groot.
